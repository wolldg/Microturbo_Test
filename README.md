# Microturbo_Test
I uploaded this program because it is simple and wanted to figure out how to upload repositories. It was part of my lab report for turbine engines class in the WMU Tech Ops Program. Writing this program was not part of the curriculum. The graphs produced by the program were part of the report.
The lab consisted of removing and replacing a Microturbo engine from its test stand and doing a test run. There was no FADEC type of system so all of the data was simply read from dial indicators.
